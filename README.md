# Interactive-tutorial-for-web-application
 designed and developed an interactive tutorial web application focusing on JavaScript libraries. Our project encompassed the creation of a user-friendly tutorial platform dedicated to chart and live validation JavaScript libraries. Users could log in and seamlessly engage in their learning journey by exploring comprehensive information provided within the application. An integral component of this platform was the provision of a live coding environment, which allowed users to practice coding and immediately witness real-time results through an integrated compiler. The application also incorporated a quiz feature, enabling users to assess and test their skills effectively. To enhance the learning experience CodePen feature is added allowing users to practice coding and instantly view the results. The technologies employed in the development of this application encompassed HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, jQuery, and MongoDB."
